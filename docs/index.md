# ResoniteLink

ResoniteLink is an interoperability layer built on top of WebSockets allowing you to easily build external tools from any programming language.

> [!WARNING]
> Currently this library is in "beta" state. It's just been recently released, and we're seeking for feedback on the protocol and are still open to significant breaking changes.

This documentation provides technical documentation for the [reference implementation](https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/ResoniteLink), written in C#; as well as API documentation for ResoniteLink.

You can use the navigation bar on top to navigate to the different sections of the documentation.

A quick [getting started](docs/started.md) guide is also provided if you wish to use this reference implementation in one of your projects.
