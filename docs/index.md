# ResoniteLink

ResoniteLink is an interoperability layer built on top of WebSockets allowing you to easily build external tools from any programming language.

> [!WARNING]
> Currently this library is in "beta" state. It's just been recently released, and we're seeking for feedback on the protocol and are still open to significant breaking changes.

This documentation provides technical documentation for the [reference implementation](https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/ResoniteLink), written in C#; as well as API documentation for ResoniteLink.
