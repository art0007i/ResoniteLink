# Contributions to ResoniteLink

## How can I help?
If you'd like to help us and other community members, there's a number of ways to contribute!

### Contributing to this repository
We'll accept certain contributions to this repository if they meet our quality standards. Such as:
- Improving documentation of the models
- Writing JSON schema (we currently don't provide this, but feel free to contribute this!)
- Adding core helper/utility classes
    - E.g. analogous to the `REPL_Controller` or `LinkInterface`
    - They need to be general and reusable components - if they are very use-case specific, we might recommend making a separate library instead
- Adding helper methods to the models
    - E.g. to make certain common interactions easier (e.g. simpler parsing for engine primitives)
- Writing more examples & guides
- Writing unit tests - tests are good!

We reserve right to reject any contributions if we feel they are not suitable for this repository - however you can always publish them as your own library!

### Building libraries & integrations for other languages
One of the goals is to allow interoperability with many other tools and languages. E.g. a ResoniteLink implementation for Python/JavaScript/Java/... will let anyone familiar with this language use it for programmaticaly building and manipulating Resonite worlds.

### Building tools & integrations
The more tools and engines Resonite gets integrated with, the more powerful it becomes! We will be building Unity SDK ourselves officially, but if you'd like to use this to build SDK's for other game engines (such as Godot, UnrealEngine and such) or integrate Resonite with tools like Blender, feel free!

### Building / generating cool worlds
And of course, great way to help this and Resonite used more is to just use it to build cool things with it! :)
